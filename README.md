# NSPGui
NSPGui is an early-in-dev UI for combining Nintendo Switch NSP -Nintendo Submission Package- files back together after dumping them using a FAT32 filesystem. 
This can easily be done with a command line however I wanted to include neat features like a progress bar and other handy features. 
The program is very early in development and for the next revision I have many new features in the works. 
In the future I'm thinking of adding other capabilities related to Switch Home Brew. 

Visual Studio VB.NET 4.7.0 framework 
Program tested in Windows only. 
Test files dumped using Atmosphere CFW, nxdumptool and Hekate. 

Alpha 1.0.1.1


To Use the Program, Select the folder in which the separted files are kept.
Must just be *.?? (files, no suffix) and named in order of dump.
EG; 

00    (file)
01    (file)

Then, enter the name of the output NSP. Ususally if you dump using nxdumptool, you will find a folder named the NSP title. This is the folder you select.
Then, Make file. Yay.
